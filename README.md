# Old-Youtube-Layout-2017-2022
Just hate the new YouTube UI so I tinkered with it to make it look like the old one. Not a great success but it gets half the work done.

Install Tampermonkey or any-other userscript extension and copy this code and paste it there.
Some color changes to make it not so sharp black and made the buttons boxy.
Other than that nothing much in here.
